### Ransomware Riddles

In this assignment, you will play the role of a cybersecurity analyst at Nakatomi Hospital.

Unfortunately, one of the hospital's doctors opened an email containing ransomware.

This ransomware spread throughout the hospital and encrypted all patient records.

The ransomware has given you two options to decrypt and retrieve the patient records: either pay 100 Bitcoins or solve six riddles.

Since you refuse to pay a ransom, you'll have to solve six cryptographic riddles. Act fast: the doctors need to access the patient records as lives are at stake!

## Instructions
In order to solve the riddles, apply the cryptographic concepts that we've covered in the past three lessons.

- Once you've solved a riddle, submit your answer on the bottom of the Riddle page.

- If you have solved the riddle correctly, you will receive a key. Keep notes of all the riddle answers and keys. You will use those keys to answer the questions in this quiz.

- Once you have collected all six keys, select the Ransomware Decrypted header on the website and enter all your keys.

- If all six keys are correct, the ransomware will be removed and the data will be decrypted.

Good luck, and act fast—the Nakatomi patients are counting on you!

IMPORTANT: Please review your answers carefully before submitting to ensure that they are free of spelling and spacing errors. Incorrect spelling or incorrect spacing syntax will be marked as incorrect answers.
